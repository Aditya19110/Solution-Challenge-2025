Assignment: Explain the concept of Neural Networks.

Answer:
A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process data and learn patterns. The primary components of a neural network include:
1. Input Layer - Receives raw data.
2. Hidden Layers - Apply transformations to detect patterns.


Neural networks are widely used in deep learning, enabling applications such as image recognition, speech processing, and autonomous systems.
